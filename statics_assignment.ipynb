It provides tools and techniques to help us understand patterns, relationships, and trends within data. Statistics is a fundamental aspect of various fields, including science, social sciences, economics, business, engineering, and more. It plays a crucial role in making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.\n",

    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involve organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in a meaningful way. It includes measures such as mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, and percentiles. Descriptive statistics provide a snapshot of the data's central tendency, spread, and distribution.\n",

    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involve drawing conclusions or making predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It includes techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis, and analysis of variance (ANOVA).

    "Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "Descriptive statistics involve summarizing and describing data in a meaningful way to provide an overview of its characteristics. This type of statistics helps to organize and simplify large datasets, making them easier to understand.\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (Average): Calculating the average score of a class to understand the overall performance of students.\n",
    "Median: Finding the middle value of a dataset to represent a typical value in a skewed distribution.\n",
    "Standard Deviation: Measuring the spread of exam scores to determine the consistency or variability of student performance.\n",
    "Range: Identifying the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures recorded in a month to assess temperature variability.\n",
    "Inferential Statistics:\n",
    "Inferential statistics involve making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. This type of statistics helps generalize conclusions from a smaller dataset to a larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Testing: Testing whether a new drug is effective by comparing its effects on a sample of patients with a control group that received a placebo.\n",
    "Confidence Intervals: Estimating the average height of a population with a certain level of confidence based on measurements from a sample of individuals.\n",
    "Regression Analysis: Determining the relationship between advertising spending and sales to predict the impact of future advertising campaigns on sales figures.\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Comparing the effects of different types of fertilizers on crop yield by analyzing data from various experimental plots.\n",
